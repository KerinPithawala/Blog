        <description>Linked list as the name suggests is a list of elements grouped linearly. // A unit element in a linked list consists of the following components:
Data Address of neighbour element/s We refer to this unit element as a node. Therefore, a linked list is a set of nodes. The last node in the linked list points to null, indicating that the linked list has ended.
Depending upon the number of nodes that are accessed directly, linked lists are further classified into:</description>

        <description>A multidimensional array is an array consisting of more than 2 dimensions. We can perceive three dimensions at most. To visual 3-dimensional array, let&amp;rsquo;s take an example of a cube.
Therefore, the array is cube[3][3][3].
For better understanding, represent a 3-D array as a combination of 2-D arrays. Note: The two-dimensional array must have the same size.

To conclude, a three dimensional array has arr[sub-array number][row][column].
Application of 3-D array  To represent real-world location co-ordinates.</description>

        <description>Overview of two dimensional array A two-dimensional array is an array of array. For example, consider a sample time table.
Here, the days are an array. Each day consists of an array within them. Thus it forms a 2-D array with 6 columns and 7 rows. The text entered in each box acts as an element.
The advantages and disadvantages of a 2-dimensional array are the same as a 1-dimensional array as I mentioned in this blog on 1D Array.</description>

        <description>One Dimensional Array Simplified Array: A data structure which stores homogenous data types in continuous memory allocation is known as an Array. It stored several related items using a single name. Different elements can be accessed using the index.
Consider a cupboard in your local library. It has different sections for different genres of book. Each section can accommodate a specific number of books.
Now consider the section of Mathematics wherein one would only find books on mathematics.</description>
